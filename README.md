<h2>Class 2: Prompt 201 - August 31</h2>
<b>1. Describe one thing you're learning in class today.</b>
<p>I learned how the ! (not) operator worked, which took some time but ultimately I got there. Also, I learned that JavaScript will actually accept a string even if there's an expected number value. In today's example, it was checking whether num1 > 0 was true or false. Me and the rest of my classmates thought that if num1 = "7" (a string) and not num1 = 7 (a number) that the function would mark it as false. However, it accepted it even though it was a string value.</p>
<b>2. What is the difference between == and === ?</b>
<p> == will accept two different data types, like a string and a number, as long as they contain the same value, like "7" and 7. === is more precise, in that it will only accept towo matching values and data types. </p>
<b>3. What is the value of foo in var foo = 10 + '20'?</b>
